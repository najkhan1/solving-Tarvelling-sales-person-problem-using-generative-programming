# solving-Tarvelling-sales-person-problem-using-generative-programming
A TSP solution based on Generative programming using combination of Dijkstra's algorithm and Primm's algorithm
This approach uses genrative programming to calulate best path for TSP in under 94 seconds for upto 18 cities.
The algorithm was taken from Jon Bentley's algorithm presented in an MIT lecture
